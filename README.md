# What I Learnt fromt this project

I deepened my understanding of DOM manipulation by learning about concepts such as SetInterval, setTimeout, clearInterval, window.scrollTo and callback functions. Moreover, I also acquired the knowledge of adding background music using JavaScript, as well as the ability to control playback functions such as play, pause, and restart.
